Afterwards, preprocessed the data by scaling each product category and then identified (and removed) unwanted outliers.\r\nWith the good, clean customer spending data, I applied PCA transformations to the data and implemented clustering algorithms to segment the transformed customer data. Finally, I compared the segmentation found with an additional labeling and consider ways this information could assist the wholesale distributor with future service changes.\r\n\r\nIn this project, I explained the following key techniques of unsupervised learning in the reports (customer_segments_YOONSUPARK.ipynb, customer_segments_YOONSUPARK.html) :\r\n\r\n####How to apply preprocessing techniques such as feature scaling and outlier detection.\r\n####How to interpret data points that have been scaled, transformed, or reduced from PCA.\r\n####How to analyze PCA dimensions and construct a new feature space.\r\n####How to optimally cluster a set of data to find hidden patterns in a dataset.\r\n####How to assess information given by cluster data and use it in a meaningful way.\r\n",
